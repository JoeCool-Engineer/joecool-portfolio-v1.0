      <p>I am a Mechanical Engineer with a healthy appetite to learn and be the very best that I can be. Eager to learn the most so that I may become a competitive individual within my field. With this being said, I’m a firm believer in the idea that people become stronger in their fields as they teach or pass on the knowledge/skills that they have obtained. I work very well in teams but at the same time a self-starter and self-reliant individual capable of greatness.</p>

It gives me a great since of pride to possess skills that will not only aid in future employment but take home for my own personal gains.</p>
